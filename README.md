This repository contains some home-made bioinformic scripts. 
## Why I write this repository?
I am a student working on non-model plants. Unlike model organism, reams of annotation need to be done on non-model plants mannually. So
I put my home-made scripts in this repository.
## What's in this repository
1. parse_eggNOG.py
2. convert_SRX.py
